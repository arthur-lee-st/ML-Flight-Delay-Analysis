# ML-Flight-Delay-Analysis

Practice using Apache Spark, Databricks, Jupyter Notebook, Machine Learning (Classifier), PySpark, Python, SQL

Objective of this analysis is to see which Machine Learning Classifier is best for predicting whether or not a flight would be delayed.
I created this Jupyter Notebook analysis originally on Databricks.
